# pydantic-models
Beginner-friendly Pydantic examples covering validation, nested models, and serialization in Python

This repository contains a collection of simple and beginner-friendly examples demonstrating how to use the Pydantic
 library in Python.

The goal of this project is to show how data validation, parsing, and serialization can be implemented in a clear and understandable way. Each example is written to be short, focused, and easy to run.

🚀 What’s Inside

- Basic Models → Using BaseModel and type hints

- Field Validation → Adding constraints with Field and Annotated

- Field Validators → Writing custom validation logic

- Model Validators → Applying rules across multiple fields

- Computed Fields → Generating values dynamically

- Nested Models → Handling structured data inside models

- Serialization → Converting models to dict/JSON


🛠️ Run the Examples

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pydantic-models.git
cd pydantic-examples
pip install pydantic

Run any example:
python 1_basic_model.py


🎯 Why This Project

- Shows how to structure Python projects clearly

- Demonstrates practical use of typing and validation

- Contains self-explanatory examples instead of heavy theory

- Written in a way that’s approachable for beginners but still professional


🔑 Key Takeaway
Pydantic makes Python code safer, cleaner, and easier to maintain by ensuring that the data your application works with is always valid.
